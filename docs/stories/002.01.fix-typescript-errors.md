# Story 002.01: Fix TypeScript Compilation Errors

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** maintainer,  
**I want** all TypeScript errors resolved,  
**so that** the library compiles without errors and can be released as v2.0.0.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Run `npm run type-check` passes without errors
2. All 11 reported TypeScript errors are fixed
3. No new errors are introduced
4. All tests still pass (`npm test`)
5. Build succeeds in all packages (`npm run build`)
6. CI/CD pipeline passes

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Run `npm run type-check` and document all current errors (AC: 1)
- [ ] Fix type errors in adapter implementations (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Review adapter-native errors
  - [ ] Review adapter-date-fns errors
  - [ ] Review adapter-luxon errors
  - [ ] Review adapter-temporal errors
- [ ] Fix missing type exports in core package (AC: 2)
- [ ] Fix incorrect type constraints (AC: 2)
- [ ] Fix module resolution issues (AC: 2)
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions (AC: 4)
- [ ] Verify all packages build successfully (AC: 5)
- [ ] Push changes and verify CI/CD passes (AC: 6)

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree
From architecture document, key type-related files:
- `packages/core/src/types.ts` - Core type definitions
- `packages/core/src/index.ts` - Main exports including types
- `packages/adapter-*/src/adapter.ts` - Adapter implementations
- `packages/*/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configurations

### Known Issues
Based on the original story:
- Type errors in adapter implementations
- Missing type exports
- Incorrect type constraints
- Module resolution issues

### Technical Context
- All packages use `"type": "module"` (ESM)
- TypeScript version: ^5.7.3
- Monorepo with shared tsconfig in `packages/tsconfig/`
- Each package has its own tsconfig extending the base

### Critical Files to Check
1. Check type exports in `packages/core/src/index.ts`
2. Verify adapter interfaces match in all adapter packages
3. Check module resolution in package.json exports fields
4. Ensure tsconfig paths are correctly configured

## Testing

### Test Requirements
- Run `npm run type-check` from root - must pass with 0 errors
- Run `npm test` from root - all tests must pass
- Run `npm run build` from root - all packages must build
- Verify in IDE (VS Code) - no red squiggles in any TypeScript files

### Validation Commands
```bash
# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Run tests
npm test

# Build all packages
npm run build

# Check specific package
npm run type-check --workspace=@usetemporal/core
```
