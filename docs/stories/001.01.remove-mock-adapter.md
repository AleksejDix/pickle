# Story 001.01: Remove Mock Adapter

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** QA engineer,
**I want** to test against real adapters and not mocks,
**so that** our tests accurately reflect real-world adapter behavior and catch integration issues.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Mock adapter files are completely removed from the codebase
2. All tests currently using mockAdapter are converted to use real adapters
3. Multi-adapter testing approach is applied consistently
4. Existing multi-adapter tests continue to work unchanged
5. New test conversions follow the established multi-adapter testing pattern
6. Integration with test utilities maintains current behavior
7. All tests pass after mock adapter removal
8. Test coverage is maintained or improved
9. No regression in test reliability

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Remove mock adapter files (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Delete `/packages/core/src/test/mockAdapter.ts`
  - [ ] Delete `/packages/core/src/test/functionalMockAdapter.ts`
  - [ ] Remove mockAdapter reference from CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Convert existing tests to multi-adapter approach (AC: 2, 3, 5)
  - [ ] Update `src/units/definitions.test.ts`
  - [ ] Update `src/unit-registry.test.ts`
  - [ ] Skip or remove outdated test files in `__tests__/` directory
- [ ] Verify test suite integrity (AC: 4, 6, 7, 8, 9)
  - [ ] Run all tests to ensure they pass
  - [ ] Verify no imports of mockAdapter remain
  - [ ] Confirm test coverage levels

## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: Tests remain in their current locations (*.test.ts files)
- Test standards: Use multi-adapter testing approach
- Testing frameworks and patterns to use:
  - Vitest as the test runner
  - Multi-adapter test template from `/packages/core/src/test/multi-adapter-test-template.ts`
  - Adapter compliance tests as reference: `/packages/core/src/test/run-adapter-compliance.test.ts`
- Specific testing requirements for this story:
  - Each test should run against all real adapters (native, date-fns, luxon)
  - Tests must maintain isolation between adapter runs
  - Use the existing shared test utilities for adapter setup

### Context
- **Existing System Integration:**
  - Integrates with: Core test suite
  - Technology: TypeScript, Vitest testing framework
  - Follows pattern: Multi-adapter testing pattern (already established)
  - Touch points: Mock adapter files and tests currently importing them

- **Integration Approach:** Replace mockAdapter imports with real adapter setup using existing multi-adapter test utilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** `/packages/core/src/test/multi-adapter-test-template.ts` and adapter compliance tests
- **Key Constraints:** Must maintain test isolation and performance

### Risk and Compatibility
- **Primary Risk:** Tests may fail if they depend on specific mock adapter behavior
- **Mitigation:** Use existing multi-adapter test template to ensure proper setup
- **Rollback:** Git revert if issues arise (changes are isolated to test files)
