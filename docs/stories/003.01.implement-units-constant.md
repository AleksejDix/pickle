# Story 003.01: Implement UNITS Constant Object

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** a single UNITS object with all time unit constants,  
**so that** I get better autocomplete and cleaner imports when using the library.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. UNITS constant object is added to `src/types.ts`
2. All existing unit constants are included in the UNITS object
3. Backward compatibility is maintained (individual exports still work)
4. TypeScript autocomplete works when typing `UNITS.`
5. Tree-shaking still works for unused constants
6. Bundle size does not increase for existing imports

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Locate existing constants in `packages/core/src/types.ts` (AC: 1)
- [ ] Create UNITS object with all constants (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Include YEAR, QUARTER, MONTH, WEEK, DAY
  - [ ] Include HOUR, MINUTE, SECOND
  - [ ] Include STABLE_MONTH, CUSTOM
- [ ] Add comprehensive JSDoc documentation (AC: 4)
- [ ] Add TypeScript type for UnitsObject (AC: 4)
- [ ] Verify individual exports still work (AC: 3)
- [ ] Test autocomplete in IDE (AC: 4)
- [ ] Verify tree-shaking with build analysis (AC: 5, 6)
- [ ] Update exports in `packages/core/src/index.ts` (AC: 1)

## Dev Notes

### Implementation Details
Based on the analysis, add after existing constants:

```typescript
/**
 * All available time unit constants grouped for better autocomplete and imports.
 * 
 * @example
 * import { UNITS } from 'usetemporal'
 * 
 * // Better autocomplete
 * const months = divide(temporal, year, UNITS.MONTH)
 * const days = divide(temporal, month, UNITS.DAY)
 */
export const UNITS = {
  YEAR,
  QUARTER,
  MONTH,
  WEEK,
  DAY,
  HOUR,
  MINUTE,
  SECOND,
  STABLE_MONTH,
  CUSTOM
} as const;

export type UnitsObject = typeof UNITS;
```

### Philosophy Alignment
This change aligns with "Calculus for Time" philosophy:
- Provides fundamental building blocks
- Improves composition experience
- Doesn't add new functionality, just better ergonomics
- Maintains minimal API surface

### Technical Context
- Constants are already defined individually
- Need to ensure reference equality (UNITS.MONTH === MONTH)
- Must not break existing imports
- Should improve developer experience without cost

## Testing

### Test Requirements
- Verify `UNITS.MONTH === MONTH` (reference equality)
- Test that all constants are accessible via UNITS
- Verify TypeScript autocomplete in test file
- Check bundle size before and after change
- Ensure existing tests still pass

### Validation Steps
```typescript
// Test file to verify implementation
import { UNITS, MONTH, DAY, divide } from '@usetemporal/core'

// Reference equality
console.assert(UNITS.MONTH === MONTH)
console.assert(UNITS.DAY === DAY)

// Autocomplete test (manual in IDE)
const period = divide(temporal, year, UNITS.) // Should show all options

// Tree-shaking test
// Build with only UNITS.MONTH import vs MONTH import
// Compare bundle sizes
```
