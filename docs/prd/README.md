# Product Requirements Documents (PRD)

This folder contains Product Requirements Documents following the BMad-Method format.

## Purpose

PRDs define the requirements, scope, and structure for significant enhancements or new features. They serve as the source of truth for what needs to be built and why.

## Structure

- Main PRD: `usetemporal-prd.md` - The primary PRD for the useTemporal project
- Feature PRDs: Additional PRDs for major feature additions (if needed)

## Creating a New PRD

Use the BMad PRD template:
- For new projects: `/BMad:create-doc prd-tmpl`
- For brownfield enhancements: `/BMad:create-doc brownfield-prd-tmpl`

## Key Sections

1. **Project Analysis** - Understanding current state
2. **Requirements** - Functional and non-functional requirements
3. **Epic Structure** - Breaking down work into epics and stories
4. **Technical Constraints** - Architecture and integration considerations

PRDs should be created before starting major development work and updated as requirements evolve.
