# Epic 001: BMad Documentation Structure Implementation

## Epic Goal
Transform the useTemporal project documentation from its current ad-hoc structure into a professional BMad-Method compliant system that provides clear development process, separates user and developer documentation, and enables efficient AI-agent assisted development.

## Background
The project has reached a critical point where the lack of structured process is causing confusion and risking the integrity of existing functionality. This epic establishes professional development processes through BMad documentation structure.

## Stories
- 001.01: Create BMad PRD and Architecture Documents ✅
- 001.02: Establish BMad Folder Structure ✅
- 001.03: Migrate Active Stories (In Progress)
- 001.04: Archive Historical Documentation
- 001.05: Update CLAUDE.md and Create Developer Guide

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All development documentation follows BMad structure
2. Clear separation between user docs (/vitepress) and dev docs (/docs)
3. All active stories migrated to new structure with proper formatting
4. Historical documentation archived or removed
5. CLAUDE.md updated with new structure references
6. Developer guide created for future contributors

## Dependencies
- None - this is a standalone documentation effort

## Integration Requirements
- Must not break existing VitePress documentation
- Must preserve git history where possible
- Must maintain compatibility with existing CI/CD processes

## Status
**In Progress** - Stories 1.1 and 1.2 completed
