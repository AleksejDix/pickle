### üîÑ Migration from Pickle v0.x

If you're migrating from the original Pickle library:

1. **Package name change**: `pickle` ‚Üí `usetemporal`
2. **Import changes**: `import { pickle }` ‚Üí `import { usePickle }`
3. **TypeScript support**: Now included by default
4. **New composables**: Individual time unit composables available
5. **Enhanced API**: More consistent and predictable interface

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Notes

This release represents **5 years of evolution** from the original Pickle concept created in 2019-2020. The library was ahead of its time, anticipating Vue 3's Composition API patterns before they were finalized.

Key architectural innovations:

- **Data-first design** over UI-first approaches
- **Fractal time patterns** enabling infinite scalability
- **Mathematical precision** eliminating calendar edge cases
- **Composable architecture** for maximum flexibility
