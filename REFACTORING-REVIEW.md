# useTemporal Project Refactoring Review

## Executive Summary

The useTemporal project has undergone a significant architectural transformation from a simple library structure to a modern monorepo architecture. The refactoring successfully maintains the revolutionary `divide()` pattern while introducing a modular adapter system and achieving framework-agnostic design using `@vue/reactivity`.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Monorepo Architecture ‚úÖ

Successfully transformed the project into a well-organized monorepo with:

- **Separate packages** for core functionality and each date adapter
- **Shared TypeScript configurations** in `packages/tsconfig/`
- **npm workspaces** for dependency management
- **Clean separation** between library code and examples

### 2. Modular Adapter System ‚úÖ

Created independent adapter packages:

- `@usetemporal/adapter-native` - Zero-dependency implementation
- `@usetemporal/adapter-date-fns` - date-fns integration
- `@usetemporal/adapter-luxon` - Luxon integration
- `@usetemporal/adapter-temporal` - Future-proof Temporal API support

### 3. Framework-Agnostic Design ‚úÖ

- Uses `@vue/reactivity` for reactive state management (not the Vue framework)
- Can be used with React, Angular, Svelte, or vanilla JavaScript
- Maintains reactive patterns without framework lock-in

### 4. Revolutionary divide() Pattern Preserved ‚úÖ

The core innovation remains intact:

```typescript
const temporal = createTemporal();
const year = useYear(temporal);
const months = temporal.divide(year, "month"); // Returns 12 reactive month units
```

### 5. ESM-Only Architecture ‚úÖ

- All packages use `"type": "module"`
- Modern JavaScript modules throughout
- Tree-shakeable imports for optimal bundle size

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. TypeScript Errors in Vue Example ‚ö†Ô∏è

The Vue example has TypeScript errors that prevent successful build:

- Property access issues with reactive values
- Type mismatches between expected and actual TimeUnit types
- Missing property `we` on TimeUnit interface

### 2. Adapter Requirement Breaking Change üî¥

The core library now **requires** an adapter to be provided:

```typescript
// This will throw an error:
const temporal = createTemporal(); // Error: A date adapter is required

// Must provide adapter:
const temporal = createTemporal({ dateAdapter: new NativeDateAdapter() });
```

This is a breaking change from the original design where native adapter was the default.

### 3. Missing Test Coverage üìä

Several adapter packages have no tests:

- `@usetemporal/adapter-date-fns`
- `@usetemporal/adapter-luxon`
- `@usetemporal/adapter-temporal`

### 4. Deleted Files and Lost Functionality ‚ùì

The git status shows many deleted files from the original `lib/` directory structure. Need to verify all functionality has been properly migrated to the new package structure.

## Package Structure Analysis

### Core Package (`@usetemporal/core`)

- ‚úÖ Main `createTemporal()` function implemented
- ‚úÖ All composables (useYear, useMonth, etc.) present
- ‚úÖ TypeScript types properly exported
- ‚úÖ Tests passing (36 tests)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires adapter to be explicitly provided

### Adapter Packages

- ‚úÖ Clean, consistent implementation across all adapters
- ‚úÖ Proper TypeScript typing
- ‚úÖ Native adapter fully tested (20 tests passing)
- ‚ùå Other adapters lack tests

### Main Package (`usetemporal`)

- ‚úÖ Acts as a convenience package
- ‚ùì Purpose and exports need clarification

## Build and Test Status

### Build Results

- ‚úÖ All adapter packages build successfully
- ‚úÖ Core package builds successfully
- ‚ùå Vue example fails TypeScript checks

### Test Results

- ‚úÖ Core package: 36 tests passing
- ‚úÖ Native adapter: 20 tests passing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Other adapters: No tests found

### Bundle Sizes (Core Package)

- Total: ~8KB across all modules
- Individual composables: ~1KB each
- Meets the <6KB target when using selective imports

## Recommendations

### 1. Fix Breaking Change with Adapters

Consider making the native adapter the default to maintain backward compatibility:

```typescript
export function createTemporal(
  options: ReactiveCreateTemporalOptions = {}
): TemporalCore {
  const adapter = options.dateAdapter || new NativeDateAdapter();
  // ...
}
```

### 2. Fix Vue Example TypeScript Errors

The example needs updates to properly handle reactive refs and TimeUnit types.

### 3. Add Missing Tests

Priority: Add tests for date-fns and luxon adapters as these are likely to be commonly used.

### 4. Clarify Main Package Purpose

The `packages/usetemporal/` package needs clear documentation about its purpose and what it exports.

### 5. Add Migration Guide

Since this is a major refactoring with breaking changes, a migration guide would be helpful.

## Conclusion

The refactoring successfully achieves the goals of:

- ‚úÖ Framework-agnostic architecture
- ‚úÖ Modular adapter system
- ‚úÖ Clean monorepo structure
- ‚úÖ Preserved core functionality

However, there are some issues that need immediate attention:

- üî¥ Breaking change with required adapters
- üî¥ TypeScript errors in examples
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing test coverage
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Documentation needs updating

Overall, this is a solid architectural transformation that positions useTemporal well for future growth and adoption across multiple frameworks. The modular design and zero-dependency option make it attractive for a wide range of use cases.
